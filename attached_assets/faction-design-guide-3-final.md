# End of Line - Faction Design Guide

## Overview

This document details the design philosophy, gameplay mechanics, and aesthetic guidelines for each faction in "End of Line." These factions provide asymmetric gameplay experiences while maintaining competitive balance. Each faction has a distinct playstyle, visual language, and narrative presence that shapes the player experience.

The factions in End of Line are divided into two main categories: Corporations and Runners. Each category features multiple sub-factions with unique identities and mechanics. Corporations function as "commanders" in the game, focusing on strategic control of territory, resource development, and agenda advancement. Runners function as "soldiers," engaging directly in tactical missions, hacking, and infiltration.

## Faction Interactions and Balance

### Faction Oppositions

Each Corporation sub-faction has a natural opposition among the Runner sub-factions, creating dynamic and thematic matchups:

- **NBN ↔ Criminal**: Information control vs. stealth, tagging vs. tag vulnerability. Criminals provide sensational news stories for NBN, while anticipating eventual exposure and planning accordingly.
- **Jinteki ↔ Shaper**: Deception vs. innovation, traps vs. technical expertise. Jinteki represents the dark side of the Builder archetype, with advanced tech that counters Shapers' careful planning and rig construction.
- **Weyland ↔ Anarch**: Corporate might vs. chaos, industrial power vs. disruptive tactics. The archetypal corporate overlord facing off against the rebellious punk, with Weyland's meat damage and resource destruction against Anarchs' ability to crash through barriers at personal cost.
- **Haas-Bioroid ↔ Shaper**: Artificial vs. organic creation, efficiency vs. innovation. While HB has a more balanced approach against all runner types, they stand in particular contrast to Shapers as both factions focus on building and engineering but with fundamentally different philosophies.

### Territory-Based Interactions

- Controlling adjacent territories creates border conflicts
- Faction-controlled territories generate faction-specific resources
- Runner activities in corporate territories can trigger corporate responses
- Corporate initiatives can affect runner safe havens

### Event-Based Interactions

- Anarch players can burn resources to start riots, increasing physical danger but disabling surveillance
- Criminal players benefit from city volatility, gaining economic advantages during unrest
- Shaper players can establish community networks, providing territory-wide benefits to runners
- Corps can initiate coordinated responses to runner activities

### Balance Mechanisms

- Asymmetric victory conditions and resource curves
- Risk/reward trade-offs for powerful abilities
- Counter-play options for each strategy
- Dynamic difficulty scaling through territory control shifts
- Multi-runner parties can balance against powerful corporate setups

### Faction Opposition Mechanics (Hackathon Version)

The cards above demonstrate the core opposition between Weyland and Anarch:

1. **Weyland's Brute Force vs. Anarch's Chaos**
   - Weyland's "Reinforced Wall" punishes Anarchs' tendency to trash ICE
   - Anarch's "Data Corruptor" gradually weakens Weyland's strong barriers
   - "Brute Force" allows Anarchs to break through barriers but at a cost (self-damage)

2. **Territory Control Dynamics**
   - Weyland's "Territory Lockdown" secures their controlled areas
   - Anarch's "Riot Instigator" reduces security in territories, countering Weyland's control
   - "Construction Contract" allows Weyland to quickly advance their agenda in their territories

3. **Damage and Destruction**
   - Weyland's "Private Security Force" and "Corporate Enforcer" deal direct damage
   - Anarchs recycle and gain value from destruction with "Scrapheap"
   - Anarchs' willingness to take damage (as seen in "Brute Force") counters Weyland's damage strategy

This simplified implementation of the faction opposition showcases how the core thematic and mechanical conflicts between Weyland and Anarch can be represented even in a minimal viable product version.
