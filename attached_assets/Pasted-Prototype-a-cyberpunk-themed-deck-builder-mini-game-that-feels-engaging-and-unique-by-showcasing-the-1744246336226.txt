Prototype a cyberpunk-themed deck-builder mini-game that feels engaging and unique by showcasing the following features from indie PvP deckbuilding research:


Core loop inspired by roguelike deckbuilders (like Balatro and Slay the Spire):

Players start with a small basic deck.
They build and refine this deck during the run by acquiring new cards from semi-randomized market/offers that refresh after combat or turns.
Supports procedural/bursting synergies: some runs feel broken, some fail fast — replay value.

Cyberpunk flavor:

Cards represent hacks, programs, cyberware, or street-level actions, not just generic spells.
Include hidden information or asymmetric play inspired by Netrunner — e.g., some face-down 'server' cards or bluff elements [roguebasin.com].
Optionally, factions like corps, street gangs, or runners shaping card keywords and combos [weheartgames.itch.io].

Unusual/innovative features to showcase:

Deck culling/trashing AND deck fusing:

Ability to trash weak cards mid-run (to streamline the deck).
Ability to fuse/synthesize two cards into a more powerful hybrid occasionally — inspired by SolForge Fusion’s deck mixing.
Alternating or action-point turn structure:

Don't just do solo solitaire.
Simulate 2 players alternating quick actions (e.g., reveal bluff card, hack, counter-hack) to avoid downtime.
Include at least one interactive element—like an attack/disrupt card (discard, “trace”, corrupt), or face-down install/trap bluff.
Synergy engine focus:

Use keywords/tags (e.g., "Virus", "Weapon", "Stealth", "ICE") that combo with each other.
Some cards act as payoffs for many of a keyword ("Gain +2 power for every Virus you’ve played") to encourage pursuit of themed engines during the run.
Shared or draft market mechanics:

Cards appear in a procedural market/draft row.
Buying removes it and denies it to the other player.
Refresh between turns or on buy to keep the market dynamic.
Element of push-your-luck:

Inspired by cyberpunk “danger zones,” allow players to risk drawing more cards at a cost (taking “trace” damage or chance of detection).

Additional inspiration (optional):

Faction reputation or influence: your choices lean toward corp or underground, which could unlock or block certain cards/offers.
Procedurally-generate a dystopian city grid or virtual net, and nodes unlock new cards or market refreshes.

Deliverable:

Implement in Python or JavaScript.

A simple text-based or console game (no fancy UI needed).

Two players compete head-to-head or simulate a single player run with deck growth, synergy build-up, trashing, and at least some direct interaction (attack/bluff/denial).

Demonstrate the interesting mechanics above around synergy, bluff, disruptive cards, deck culling, and cyberpunk theme.

Why this is especially suited:

Balatro-like “run-based” add/trash deck-building with crazy synergy potential.

Cyberpunk flavor and bluff / asymmetric info echoes Netrunner.

PvP/draft aspects and unusual deck manipulation (trashing, fusing)

Emphasis on fast turns, meaningful choices and player interaction, rather than solitaire.

Sample seed notes you could add to the prompt:

“Think of it as a cross between Balatro, Netrunner, and a cyberpunk roguelike: quick runs with decks that grow crazy, bluffing attacks, hacker vs corp themes, and cool keyword combos.”


This focused prompt should help the agent prototype a really novel piece — testing unusual mechanisms rather than a generic Magic clone, while embracing that fast, flashy, almost slot-machine quality that Balatro captures.
