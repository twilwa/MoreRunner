- [ ] Implement visual indicators showing synergy relationships between cards

## YAML DSL Processor

- [ ] Create a YAML parser to read card definitions from DSL
- [ ] Implement a component factory to create components from parsed YAML
- [ ] Build a card factory that assembles cards from components
- [ ] Add validation to ensure card descriptions match component behaviors

## Card Text Processor

- [ ] Create a text parser that extracts effect patterns from card text
- [ ] Implement a component mapper that matches text patterns to components
- [ ] Build a card description validator to verify text matches components
- [ ] Create a component suggestion system for card creation

## Faction & Keyword System

- [ ] Implement faction-specific component bonuses
- [ ] Create keyword tracker to monitor keywords in play
- [ ] Build keyword synergy visualization in the UI
- [ ] Implement faction identity system (player alignment bonuses)

## Testing & Balancing

- [ ] Create unit tests for each component type
- [ ] Implement integration tests for component combinations
- [ ] Build an automated balance testing system
- [ ] Create a component metrics tracker to analyze component usage

## Documentation & Tutorials

- [ ] Create component API documentation
- [ ] Write tutorials for creating custom cards with components
- [ ] Document common component patterns and combinations
- [ ] Create visual guides for the component system

## Priority Implementation Order

1. **High Priority (For Immediate Implementation)**
   - Complete all remaining effect components
   - Implement visual indicators for component effects
   - Add component tooltips to cards

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Implement YAML DSL processor
   - Develop faction-specific component bonuses
   - Create additional conditional components

3. **Lower Priority**
   - Build automated testing framework
   - Implement advanced control flow components
   - Create component metrics tracking system
